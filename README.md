This tutorial explores spectral analysis techniques for climate data using Python. It covers fundamental concepts like the Fourier Transform and the periodogram for identifying periodic components in climate timeseries. The tutorial addresses the impact of red noise, which commonly affects climate data, and demonstrates how to assess the significance of spectral peaks using Monte Carlo simulations. It also illustrates techniques like bandpass filtering to isolate specific frequency ranges.
